# PostgreSQL Database Security Setup

Follow these steps to set up and secure your PostgreSQL database:

## Database Initialization

1. **Initialize the Database:** Start by initializing your database, creating schemas, tables, and functions. You can perform this step using the superuser or a user with adequate privileges.

2. **Switch to `db_admin` User:** For security purposes, switch to the `db_admin` user to perform the initial setup of tables and functions.

## Secure Stored Procedures

3. **Add Security Definer to Stored Procedures:** Ensure that all stored procedures are created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` option. This setting allows the procedures to run with the privileges of the owner, enhancing security.

4. **Revoking Access from Public User:** For added security, revoke access to all stored procedures and functions from the `public` user. The `public` user should not have access to these objects.

## Grant Specific Access

5. **Grant Functions to Specific Users:** Carefully grant the `EXECUTE` privilege on specific stored procedures and functions to the users who need access. Avoid granting overly broad privileges to maintain a principle of least privilege.

6. **Implement User Roles:** Consider creating user roles to group users with similar access needs. This simplifies permission management and enhances security.

## Periodic Security Audits

7. **Perform Regular Security Audits:** Schedule periodic security audits to review user privileges, stored procedures, and data access. Ensure that access rights align with the principle of least privilege.

## Keep Detailed Documentation

8. **Maintain Detailed Documentation:** Document all security-related actions, including user role assignments, grants, and revocations. This documentation helps with troubleshooting and compliance requirements.

By following these steps, you can establish a robust security setup for your PostgreSQL database, ensuring that sensitive data is protected and access is granted only to authorized users.

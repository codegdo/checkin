  In PostgreSQL, the superuser role is not necessarily equivalent to the owner of the entire database. These roles serve different purposes:

1. **Superuser Role (e.g., "postgres"):** A superuser in PostgreSQL has the highest level of privileges and can perform any action within the database, including creating, altering, and dropping databases, creating and dropping roles, and performing administrative tasks that regular users cannot do. A superuser can also grant and revoke privileges to and from other roles.

2. **Database Owner:** The owner of a specific database within PostgreSQL is a role that has certain administrative privileges over that specific database. The database owner can create, modify, and drop objects (tables, functions, etc.) within that database, and they have control over the schema and objects within the database they own.

While superusers can generally perform actions on any database and can grant privileges, they do not automatically become owners of databases. Owners of databases are typically regular roles that have been granted certain administrative privileges within a specific database.

It's worth noting that the superuser role can potentially perform actions that even database owners cannot restrict. However, database owners have more control over objects and actions within their specific database.

If you want a specific role to be the owner of a database, you can use the `ALTER DATABASE` command to change the database owner to that role. For example:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE your_database_name OWNER TO your_role_name;
```

This command changes the owner of the specified database to the specified role.


No, the owner of a database does not have all the actions and privileges that a superuser role has. While the owner of a database has significant administrative control over the specific database they own, there are still limitations and differences when compared to a superuser. Here are some key distinctions:

1. **Database-Level Privileges:** The owner of a database has administrative control over the objects (e.g., tables, functions) within that specific database. They can create, modify, and drop objects, manage schemas, and perform most tasks related to their database. However, they do not have privileges beyond their database.

2. **Limited Global Privileges:** A superuser has global privileges that extend to all databases within the PostgreSQL cluster. They can create and drop databases, create and drop roles, and perform administrative tasks that affect the entire PostgreSQL installation. Owners of individual databases do not have these global privileges.

3. **Database Creation:** Superusers can create new databases, while owners of a database can't create new databases directly. They can only manage objects within the database they own.

4. **User Management:** Superusers can create, modify, and drop roles (users) across the entire PostgreSQL installation. Database owners can manage roles only within their specific database.

5. **Configuration Changes:** Superusers can make changes to the PostgreSQL server's configuration settings, such as adjusting memory allocation or modifying authentication settings. Database owners cannot make these global server-level configuration changes.

In summary, while the owner of a database has substantial administrative control over that specific database, they do not have the full range of privileges and administrative capabilities that a superuser possesses across the entire PostgreSQL installation. Superusers have broader authority and control at the server level, including global privileges and configuration management.

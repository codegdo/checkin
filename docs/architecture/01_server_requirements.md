# Server Instance Requirements

## 1. Scalability

- The server instance must be capable of horizontal scaling to accommodate increased load and service demand.
- It should support the addition of new server instances as needed to maintain high availability.

## 2. Load Balancing

- Implement load balancing mechanisms to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple server instances.
- Monitor server health and automatically route traffic away from unhealthy instances.

## 3. Service Registration and Discovery

- The server instance should register itself with a service registry to announce its availability.
- Provide a service discovery mechanism for clients to locate and connect to services hosted on the instance.

## 4. Service Grouping

- Organize services into logical groups based on their functionality, such as authentication, payment processing, user management, or data storage.
- Each service group should have a dedicated endpoint for access.

## 5. Service Health Checks

- Implement health checks for services within the instance to ensure their availability.
- If a service becomes unhealthy, take appropriate action, such as restarting the service or removing it from load balancing.

## 6. Security

- Enforce security measures, including authentication and authorization, at both the instance and service level.
- Protect against common security threats, such as DDoS attacks, by implementing security policies.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring

- Enable centralized logging and monitoring for the server instance to track its performance, error rates, and resource usage.
- Use tools like Prometheus or ELK Stack for comprehensive monitoring.

## 8. Service Isolation

- Ensure that services within the instance are isolated from one another, preventing one service from affecting the operation of others.
- Employ containerization or virtualization technologies for isolation.

## 9. Service Orchestration

- Implement service orchestration mechanisms to manage the execution and interaction of services within the instance.
- Use tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for service orchestration.

## 10. Auto-Scaling

- Set up auto-scaling rules for the server instance to automatically adjust the number of instances based on resource utilization or incoming traffic.

## 11. Service Versioning

- Support service versioning to allow for backward compatibility with existing clients while introducing new features.

## 12. High Availability

- Ensure high availability of the server instance by minimizing single points of failure and implementing redundancy where necessary.

## 13. Data Management

- Manage and back up data, databases, and data storage systems used by services hosted on the instance.
- Implement data replication and failover strategies for data integrity.

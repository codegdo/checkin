   - Retry failed tasks automatically with exponential backoff.
   - Offer task cancellation and rescheduling capabilities.
   - Log task execution metrics for performance monitoring.
   - Support task event triggers for external integrations.

## Biller Server Instance

1. **Billing and Invoicing:**

   - Generate itemized invoices with clear service descriptions.
   - Handle proration for partial billing periods.
   - Support multiple payment methods, such as credit cards and bank transfers.
   - Integrate with external payment gateways and financial institutions.
   - Send payment reminders and overdue notices to customers.

2. **Financial Data Management:**
   - Store transaction records securely with encryption.
   - Maintain a transaction ledger for auditing purposes.
   - Implement real-time financial reporting and dashboard.
   - Support financial analytics for revenue forecasting.
   - Ensure compliance with financial regulations and tax laws.

## Sender Server Instance

1. **Message Sending:**

   - Deliver messages across various communication channels (email, SMS, push notifications).
   - Support message templates and personalization.
   - Enable message scheduling for specific delivery times.
   - Implement message queuing for reliability.
   - Log delivery statuses and error messages.

2. **Queue Management:**
   - Prioritize message delivery based on user preferences.
   - Implement message retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.
   - Handle message deduplication to prevent duplicate notifications.
   - Offer an API for clients to check message delivery status.
   - Ensure message persistence in case of server failures.

## Queuer Server Instance

1. **Queue Management:**

   - Handle queuing for various types of tasks, including batch processing and real-time jobs.
   - Provide queue persistence to avoid data loss during server restarts.
   - Enable queue monitoring with dashboards and metrics.
   - Support queue scaling to accommodate growing workloads.
   - Implement delay queues for deferred task execution.

2. **Task Prioritization:**
   - Support task priority levels (high, medium, low).
   - Offer priority escalation for critical tasks.
   - Implement task timeout and automatic retries.
   - Ensure FIFO (first in, first out) processing for specific queues.
   - Allow for custom queue routing and processing logic.

## Worker Server Instance

1. **Task Processing:**

   - Support multiple concurrency settings based on workload requirements.
   - Ensure fault tolerance with task checkpointing and recovery.
   - Offer resource management, including CPU and memory limits.
   - Implement scalability through dynamic worker provisioning.
   - Support fine-grained task logging and tracing.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Automatically scale based on queued tasks or workload.
   - Integrate with container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).
   - Support worker pool management with dynamic resizing.
   - Balance task distribution across worker instances.
   - Handle concurrent execution limits for individual tasks.

## Logger Server Instance

1. **Logging and Monitoring:**

   - Capture application logs with structured data for analysis.
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies.
   - Offer customizable log levels (debug, info, warning, error).
   - Integrate with log aggregation and analysis tools (e.g., ELK Stack).
   - Monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, disk) for resource usage.

2. **Security:**
   - Encrypt sensitive log data to protect confidentiality.
   - Implement access control for log retrieval.
   - Integrate with intrusion detection systems (IDS).
   - Alert on security incidents and suspicious activity.
   - Comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
